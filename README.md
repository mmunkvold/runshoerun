Building an ecommerce site as semester project 2 assignment - I called it **[Run Shoe, Run!](https://runshoerun.netlify.app/)** *(Get the ref to Forrest Gump?... :wink:)*

## Description

Assignment was to build an eccommerce site, with shoes as the product. Displaying a banner and featured products on the home page, a product page listing all products and a detail page of each product. A login to take you to the admin area where you can add/change/delete products, and a shopping cart. 

*NB! A local api was used, so no products showing on the online site as for now unfortunately.*

**Project consists of:**

- Home Page - which displays a banner and some featured products from the api call
- A Product Page which lists all products, with a search function
- Detail Page - which displays a single product, linking from the results on the Home Page and/or the Product Page
- Shopping Cart
- Login Page which takes you to the admin area where you can add/change/delete products

## Built With

- JavaScript (plain vanilla js)
- HTML
- [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/)

## Installing and running the app

You can clone the repo, but need to find your own api to use as for now to get it to work:

1. Clone the repo:

```bash
git@github.com:mmunkvold/runshoerun.git
```

2. Install the app and the dependencies:

```
npm install
```

3. To run the app, run the following command:

```bash
npm start
```
